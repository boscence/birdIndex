Bird Index
=========
This r script creates an avian (bird) sub-index for the local governments within and near the Melbourne Water operating area.

The index was created because raw species richness is not always a good indication of habitat quality/ extent/ connectivity.  The sub-index here includes only appropriate native species of bird and ignores introduced species, vagrants to the Region, pelagic seabirds, coastal birds, species with a limited distribution across our Region and arid zone or open country birds.  A list of wide-ranging riparian and wetland species was generated from assessment of the entire Birds Australia Bird Atlas database and modified in light of expert opinion.  Preliminary analyses show that species richness using this restricted list of bird species does track waterway and wetland condition.
